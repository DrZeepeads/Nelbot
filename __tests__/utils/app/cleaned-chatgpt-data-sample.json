This is because forking creates a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account, which you can modify and work on independently.\n\nTo keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.\n2. Add the original repository as a remote to your forked repository using the following command:\n```\ngit remote add upstream <original repository URL>\n```\n3. Fetch the changes from the original repository using the following command:\n```\ngit fetch upstream\n```\n4. Merge the changes from the original repository into your forked repository using the following command:\n```\ngit merge upstream/main\n```\nNote that in step 4, `main` refers to the name of the default branch of the repository. If the original repository uses a different default branch, replace `main` with the name of that branch.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your forked repository should be up-to-date with the original repository."
