I'll be here to assess your attempt and set up a recall session based on how you do. Give it your best shot to recall as much as you can about "The Solar System" topic but leave out some facts for the purpose of this tutorial; select the chat area below (Message Mentor...) then type or hit the microphone key on your keyboard.
After you receive feedback on your attempt, select "Next step..." to move forward.`,

On the topic list to the left, you will notice the icon next to the topic name has changed into a green circle with a lock. This is a happy indicator that you've successfully reviewed the topic. As days go by leading up to your next review session, this circle will slowly diminish, mirroring an estimate of your recall strength. Don't worry, we'll give you a gentle nudge when it's nearly time for a refresh.
Now, you're all set to begin creating your own topics! Just click on the "+ New topic" button located at the top left corner.
And of course, feel free to dive back in to further solidify your mastery of The Solar System!
Enjoy your learning journey!`,
