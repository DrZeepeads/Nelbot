As time progresses towards your next review session, this circle will gradually decrease, reflecting an estimate of your recall strength. We'll notify you when it's time for a refresher session.
Feel free to start creating topics by clicking on the "+ New topic" button on the top left.
You're also welcome to revisit and reinforce your understanding of The Solar System!
Happy studying!`
