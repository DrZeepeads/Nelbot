On the topic list to the left, you will notice the icon next to this topic name has changed to indicat that you've successfully reviewed the topic. As days go by leading up to your next review session, this icon will change, reflecting an estimate of your recall strength. Don't worry, we'll email you on that day with a gentle nudge when it's time for a refresh.
Now, you're all set to begin creating your own topics! Just click on the "+ New topic" button located at the top left corner.
And of course, feel free to dive back in to further solidify your mastery of The Solar System!
Enjoy your learning journey!`,
