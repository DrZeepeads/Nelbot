Its English name is derived from the Roman god of commerce and communication, who is also known as the messenger of the gods. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and is one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Like the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an extensive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.\n\nKey facts:\n1.

As a gas giant, Saturn primarily consists of hydrogen and helium. Its dense atmosphere features swirling clouds and powerful winds. The planet boasts numerous moons, with Titan being the largest, even surpassing Mercury in size.\n\nKey facts:\n1. Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system.\n2. The planet is known for its beautiful and distinctive ring system, made up of ice particles, dust, and rocks.\n3. Saturn is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.\n4. The atmosphere of Saturn is thick, with swirling clouds and strong winds.\n5. The planet has a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer.\n6. Saturn has at least 146 known moons, 63 of which are officially named, not including the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.\n7. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second-largest in the solar system, is larger than Mercury and has a substantial atmosphere."

    "topic_description": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\n\nJupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.\n\nJupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\n\nKey Facts:\n- Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.\n- It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.\n- Jupiter was the first planet to form, impacting the formation history of other planets.\n- Composed mainly of hydrogen (90% by volume) and helium.\n- Internal structure includes an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a dense inner core.\n- Outer atmosphere features latitudinal bands and the Great Red Spot.\n- Jupiter has 95 known moons, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei.\n- Ganymede is the largest moon, larger than Mercury; Callisto is second largest.\n- Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon."

    "name": "The moon",
    "topic_description": "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Over time Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking, causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. Because of this, the lunar day and the lunar month are the same length, at 29.5 Earth days. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent, the Sun's – are the main drivers of Earth's tides.\n\nIts mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as Australia.) Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive moon overall, and larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets. Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and the second highest among all Solar System moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia."

    "topic_description": "Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume."

One day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days, while its year is only 225 Earth days.\n* Scientists believe that Venus may have once been a habitable ocean world like Earth, but that was at least a billion years ago. A runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapor, which then leaked slowly into space.\n* Venus has the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover.\n* The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the strong currents and drag of its atmosphere."

It is composed mostly of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is referred to as \"ice\" or volatiles.\n\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and 28 known natural satellites. Its ring system is unique in that it is extremely dark, reflecting only about 2% of the incoming light.\n\nThe planet is named after the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities."

Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea and is represented by the astronomical symbol for Neptune's trident.\n\nUnlike the other gas giants, Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and was discovered through mathematical predictions derived from indirect observations, rather than direct empirical observation. Neptune's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter and Saturn. However, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock, similar to Uranus, and both planets are often classified as 'ice giants' to distinguish them from the gas giants.\n\nKey Facts:\n- Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System.\n- It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-most-massive planet.\n- Neptune is the densest giant planet in the Solar System.\n- It is named after the Roman god of the sea and is represented by the astronomical symbol for Neptune's trident.\n- Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye.\n- It was discovered through mathematical predictions derived from indirect observations.\n- Neptune's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.\n- Its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock.\n- Neptune and Uranus are often classified as 'ice giants' to distinguish them from the gas giants."
