Instructions:
  Introduction to the Topic:
    Provide a brief overview of the topic, including its significance and general context.
  Key Components or Concepts:
    List 10 to 30 key facts or components related to the topic. Each fact should be succinct and supported by one or two important details to aid understanding.
  Structure and Organization:
    Group related facts into categories or themes to maintain logical coherence and enhance navigability.
  Common Applications or Implications:
    Explain how the knowledge of this topic can be applied in real-world scenarios or its relevance in related fields of study.
  
Formatting Instructions:
  Ensure the study sheet is clear and easy to read. Use bullet points for lists, bold headings for sections, and provide ample spacing for clarity.`

  Correct Recall:
  You're right that Venus is the second planet from the Sun and named after the Roman goddess of love. üèÜ
  Absolutely, Venus is super hot with high surface temperatures. üî•
  Spot on about Venus having a thick atmosphere and the rotation being in the opposite direction of most planets! That's a tricky one but you nailed it! üîÑ
  Corrections:
  The surface temperature you mentioned is a bit off; it actually reaches up to 480 degrees Celsius, not 400. It‚Äôs even hotter than you thought! üå°Ô∏è
  You mentioned the atmosphere contains oxygen, but it's mostly carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid. No breathable oxygen there, unfortunately! üò∑
  Regarding Venus‚Äô past, it wasn‚Äôt just the heat that caused the water to disappear; scientists believe a runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapor, which then slowly escaped into space. üåç‚û°Ô∏èüöÄ
  Hints for Forgotten Facts:
  Think about how long a day on Venus is compared to its year. It's quite a unique aspect of the planet. Can you remember which one is longer? ü§î
  There's an interesting point about the past state of Venus related to water. What do you think Venus might have looked like a billion years ago? üíßüåê
  Take a moment to think about these hints and see if you can recall more about those specific points. You‚Äôre doing wonderfully so far, and digging a bit deeper will help solidify your understanding even more! üöÄüí°`

      Venus is the second planet from the Sun and named after the Roman goddess of love. It's known for being extremely hot, with temperatures reaching around 400 degrees Celsius. Venus actually spins backwards compared to its orbital direction because of the thick atmosphere which consists mainly of sulfuric acid clouds.
      
      It's said that Venus might have been similar to Earth with oceans a long time ago, maybe even a billion years or so.
